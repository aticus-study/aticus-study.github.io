	<h1>APPLICATION AND TOPICAL STEROID FAQs</h1>
<h2>What do I do if the area I need to treat is smaller than the area I selected?</h2>
<p>
If the area you want to treat is smaller than suggested, we recommend thinking about how much of the selected area you plan to treat and then decreasing the calculated fingertip units to adjust for this. For example: <br>
The application told me to use 2 fingertip units to treat the entire scalp. I think that only half of my child’s scalp is affected. You should then use 1 finger tip unit (half of 2) to treat the affected areas of the scalp.

<h2>Do topical steroids pass into the blood?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids rarely enter the blood. When topical steroids are used too much, they can get into the blood.
The risk of topical steroids entering the blood increases when:
<ul>
<li>They are used more than twice a day</li>
<li>They are used for long periods of time without breaks</li>
<li>They are used over large parts of the body</li>
<li>They are applied under tight fitting clothing</li>
<li>They are applied under bandages</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Do topical steroids cause infections?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids do not cause infections. The skin acts like a barrier to prevent germs from entering our body. The skin of people with eczema is not as good at keeping germs out because their barrier is not as strong. Topical steroids help make the barrier strong again.</p>


<h2>Do topical steroids make you fat?</h2>
<p>When steroid pills are taken, they can cause you to gain weight. Topical steroids do not cause you to gain weight when used as directed by your doctor. When topical steroids are used too much, some can enter your blood. When steroids are in your blood, they can affect hormone levels. When hormone levels are affected, weight gain can happen. Using too much topical steroids can happen when you are using them:
<ul>
<li>Over large parts of the body</li>
<li>Under tight fitting clothing</li>
<li>Under bandages</li>
<li>For too long or too many times a day</li>
<li>Without monitoring from a doctor</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Do topical steroids damage your skin?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids do not damage your skin when used the right amount. When used on red, rough, or itchy skin they can help make the skin healthy again. When topical steroids are used too much, they can hurt your skin. Permanent thinning of the skin and stretch marks can happen when topical steroids are used too much. Continue reading below to learn about possible side effects. You can always check with your doctor to make sure you are not using them too much.</p>


<h2>Will topical steroids effect my child’s future health?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids will not hurt your child’s health when used the right amount.</p>


<h2>Do topical steroids cause asthma?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids do not cause asthma. Steroid pills are sometimes used to treat asthma.</p>


<h2>What are some side effects of topical steroids?</h2>
<p>It is uncommon to see side effects from topical steroids. When we do see side effects they are usually only on the skin. Some possible side effects are:
<ul>
<li>Pimples</li>
<li>Lightening of skin</li>
<li>Rash around nose, eyes, mouth</li>
<li>Allergy to the medication or its ingredients</li>
<li>Stretch marks (only seen when used too much)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>What areas of skin are higher risk for side effects?</h2>
<p>Areas at higher risk for side effects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thin skin- face, eyelids, skin beneath underwear, breasts</li>
<li>Areas where skin touches skin- neck, thighs, armpits, beneath breasts</li>
</ul>
<p>
Short courses of low- medium strength topical steroids can be safe to use in these areas. Sometimes we use nonsteroidal medicines in these areas to avoid side effects.
</p>


<h2>When should I start applying topical steroids?</h2>
<p>
Moisturizer should be applied every day whether the skin is clear or rashy. This helps to decrease the amount of topical steroid needed over time.<br>
If you notice an area of skin is a little pink, rough and/or itchy with moisturizer, then you should use a medicine. Eczema plans are made special by doctors for each unique person. <br>
Sometimes a doctor may have you start to apply a nonsteroidal medicine like Eucrisa (crisaborole), tacrolimus or pimecrolimus before trying a topical steroid. <br>
You want to apply a medication as soon as you see signs or symptoms of eczema to prevent the rash from getting worse and needing a stronger medicine. <br>
Some people need to put medicine on 2-3 times per week to keep eczema under control. Talk with your doctor to see if this is right for your child.
</p>


<h2>How many times a day should I use topical steroids for?</h2>
<p>You should apply topical steroids once or twice a day as recommended by your doctor.</p>


<h2>How long should I use topical steroids for?</h2>
<p>You should use the topical steroid until the skin feels smooth. If this is taking longer than a few weeks, please make sure your doctor knows. Using a topical steroid for too long, without breaks, can cause side effects. Your doctor may want to give you a different medicine that works better for you.<br>
Eczema is a chronic condition that can come and go. It is ok to use topical steroids again if the rash comes back. If you are using topical steroids for more than a few weeks, without a break,make sure your doctor knows.
