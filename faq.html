<h2 id = "website-not-working">The website isn’t working for me, what should I do?</h2>
<p>Try using a refreshing the page, using a different browser or clearing your browsing data. If those options do not help then reach out to jc3254@cumc.columbia.edu and describe the problem you are having.</p>

<h2 id = "website-small-area">What do I do if the area I need to treat is smaller than the area I selected?</h2>
<p>
If the area you want to treat is smaller than suggested, we recommend thinking about how much of the selected area you plan to treat and then decreasing the calculated fingertip units to adjust for this. For example: <br>
The application told me to use 2 fingertip units to treat the entire scalp. I think that only half of my child’s scalp is affected. You should then use 1 finger tip unit (half of 2) to treat the affected areas of the scalp.

<h2 id="topical-steroid-what">What is a topical steroid?</h2>
<p>The word “topical” refers to medications that are applied directly onto the skin, such an ointment, cream, or lotion. “Steroids” is short for “corticosteroids,” which is a class of medications often used to treat eczema. You may also hear these medications referred to as “cortisones.” </p>

<h2 id="topical-steroid-blood">Do topical steroids pass into the blood?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids rarely enter the blood. However, when topical steroids are used more than as instructed by a doctor, they can get into the blood. The risk for this increases when:
<ul>
<li>They are used more than twice a day</li>
<li>They are used for long periods of time without breaks</li>
<li>They are used over large parts of the body</li>
<li>They are applied under tight fitting clothing</li>
<li>They are applied under bandages</li>
<li>They are used without monitoring from a doctor</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-infection">Do topical steroids cause infections?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids do not cause infections. Healthy skin acts like a barrier to prevent germs from entering our body, but in skin affected by eczema, the barrier becomes less strong and not as good at keeping germs out. Topical steroids help make the barrier strong again.</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-weight">Do topical steroids make you gain weight?</h2>
<p>When steroid pills are taken, the medicine directly enters the blood and can cause you to gain weight by affecting hormone levels. Topical steroids rarely enter the blood when used as directed by your doctor, so they will not cause weight gain. See <a href = "#topical-steroid-blood">"Do topical steroids pass into the blood?"</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2 id="topical-steroid-skin">Do topical steroids damage your skin?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids do not damage your skin when used correctly. When used on red, rough, or itchy skin they can help make the skin healthy again. However, when topical steroids are used too much or used when not needed, it can lead to certain kinds of skin damage, such as permanent thinning of the skin and stretch marks. Continue reading below to learn about possible side effects. You can always check with your doctor if you have questions on the right amount to use.</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-future">Will topical steroids affect my child’s future health?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids will not hurt your child’s health when using the right amount.</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-asthma">Do topical steroids cause asthma?</h2>
<p>Topical steroids do not cause asthma. Steroid pills are sometimes used to treat asthma.</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-side-effects">What are some side effects of topical steroids?</h2>
<p>It is uncommon to see side effects from topical steroids. When we side effects do happen, they are usually only on the skin. Some possible side effects are:
<ul>
<li>Pimples</li>
<li>Lightening of skin color</li>
<li>Rash around nose, eyes, mouth</li>
<li>Allergy to the medication or its ingredients</li>
<li>Stretch marks (only seen when used too much)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="topical-steroid-risk">What areas of skin are at higher risk for side effects?</h2>
<p>Areas at higher risk for side effects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Areas with thin skin: face, eyelids, skin beneath underwear, breasts</li>
<li>Areas where skin touches skin: neck, thighs, armpits, beneath breasts</li>
</ul>
<p>
Short courses of low to medium strength topical steroids can be safe to use in these areas. Sometimes, nonsteroidal medicines are used in these areas to avoid possible side effects.
</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-start">When should I start applying topical steroids?</h2>
<p>
Moisturizer should be applied every day whether the skin is clear or rashy. This helps protect the skin barrier and to decrease the amount of topical steroid needed over time.<br>
If you notice an area of skin is a little pink, rough and/or itchy even while using moisturizer, then you should use a medicine. You want to apply a medication as soon as you see signs or symptoms of eczema to prevent the rash from getting worse and needing a stronger medicine.<br>
After the area with eczema is treated with medication and the rash goes away, some people need to keep using the medicine 2-3 times per week to keep it away. Talk with your doctor to see if this is right for your child.<br>
Eczema plans are made special by doctors for each unique person. Sometimes, a topical steroid may be the first medicine recommended. <br>
Other times, a doctor may have you start to apply a nonsteroidal medicine like Eucrisa (crisaborole), tacrolimus, or pimecrolimus before trying a topical steroid. 
</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-times-a-day">How many times a day should I use topical steroids?</h2>
<p>You should apply topical steroids once or twice a day as recommended by your doctor.</p>


<h2 id="topical-steroid-length">How long should I use topical steroids for?</h2>
<p>You should use the topical steroid until the skin feels smooth. If this is taking longer than a few weeks, please make sure your doctor knows. Your doctor may want to give you a different
medicine that works better for you. Using a topical steroid for too long, without breaks, can cause side effects.<br>
Eczema is a chronic condition that comes and goes, and some people may notice their eczema is more active certain parts of the year. It is ok to use topical steroids again if the rash comes back. Again, if you are using topical steroids without stopping because the eczema is not going away, make sure your doctor knows.
